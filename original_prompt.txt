Project Title:
PISA Pizza Pickup App – A Laravel-based Pickup-Only Pizza Ordering Platform

Tailwind or Bootstrap for responsive UI (flexible)

👤 Customer Flow (Frontend)

📦 Menu & Item Logic
🍕 Pizzas
Customizable Topping Types:

Meats (e.g., Pepperoni, Sausage, Real Chicken = 2 toppings)

Veggies

Cheeses

Topping Limit enforced by product (e.g., 3 toppings max)

Extra toppings automatically charge per size:

Medium: $1.60, Large: $2.10, XL: $2.30, Jumbo: $2.99

No modal for extras – price increases inline automatically

Specialty Pizzas: predefined toppings (read-only), no customization

🍕 Combos
Admin-configurable combos:

2 Medium/Large/XL pizzas + wings + pop, etc.

Each pizza in combo allows separate topping selection

Radio prompt for "Add 3rd Pizza?" → shows topping input and adds cost

Auto-updates pricing with extras (like adding pop or garlic bread)

🔥 Pickup Specials
E.g., 1 XL Pizza (1 topping), 2 Large (6 combined toppings), etc.

User selects exact number of toppings

System enforces topping logic & charges for extras

🐔 Wings & Add-Ons
Jumbo wings with rub/sauce options, size selection

Garlic bread with optional cheese (+$1.50)

Pop (2L or 4-pack)

🛍️ Upsells
Upsells appear after item is added or in cart:

e.g., “Add 1 lb wings for $10.49?” or “Add 4 pops for $4.99?”
