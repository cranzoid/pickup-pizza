## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

### Admin Reporting Tests

The `AdminReportingTest` class contains tests for the admin dashboard and reporting functionality. The following tests have been implemented:

1. **Product Popularity Breakdown Test** (`test_product_popularity_breakdown`): Tests the product reporting functionality by creating sample orders and products, then verifying that the product sales reports show the correct quantities and revenue.

2. **Admin Dashboard Basic Test** (`test_admin_dashboard_basic`): Tests basic access to the admin dashboard, ensuring the page loads correctly.

3. **Payment Methods Basic Test** (`test_payment_methods_basic`): Tests that payment methods are correctly tracked and can be retrieved from the database.

4. **Report Filtering Basic Test** (`test_report_filtering_basic`): Tests filtering orders by date, payment method, and status.

5. **Export Basic Test** (`test_export_basic`): Tests basic export functionality by creating a CSV representation of orders.

To run the tests:

```bash
php artisan test tests/Feature/AdminReportingTest.php
```

### Test Data Structure

The `createTestData()` method in `AdminReportingTest` creates a structured set of test data:

-   4 orders (today, yesterday, last week, last month)
-   2 payment methods (stripe, pickup)
-   3 categories (Pizzas, Wings, Drinks)
-   4 products (pepperoni pizza, hawaiian pizza, buffalo wings, coca cola)

### Notes on Test Implementation

The tests were adapted to match the actual database schema, with special handling for:

1. The polymorphic relationship in `OrderItem` model using `item_type` and `item_id` fields
2. The image path field name (`image_path` instead of `image`)
3. Status field name (`order_status` instead of `status`)

The implementation focuses on testing the core functionality while being resilient to schema changes.
